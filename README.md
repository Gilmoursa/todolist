# Title: Todo List
a simple to do list for working with JS, CSS, and HTML

## Goal
 The goal here is just to setup a github repo and get all the parts working together
 

## Thoughts 
 This has been a fun project. So far, I've made a todo list app using JS, CSS, and HTML. I used VSCode as my editor and github desktop for committing my changes. 


## Features
1. Create a category or remove an existing category
2. Add a task to your list and assign it one of those categories you created in step 1
3. Remove a task or edit the name of the task

## Wishlist
At some point, I'd like to make each category on my list editable, so that changing a category changes all of the tasks that previously had that category into the new category label. I could see this being useful for correcting typos in category names
